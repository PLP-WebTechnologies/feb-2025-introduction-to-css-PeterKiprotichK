        <h1>Welcome to My Stylish Web Page</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph of text with some neat styling, making it easier to read and pleasant to the eye. The text is styled using a larger font size, a good line height, and a justified alignment to make it neat.</p>
        
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder Image" class="logo">
        
        <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted text block with a bright background and a left border. It's designed to draw attention and stand out from other content.</p>
        
        <p id="special">This is some special content with unique green styling. The text is bold, larger in size, and stands out due to the background color and box shadow.</p>
        
        <p>And here's a normal paragraph to see how the text looks when it's not highlighted or specially styled. The design is clean and simple for readability.</p>
